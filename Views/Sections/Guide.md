# Guide on Using Sections

The Section is a type of view that is used to display dynamic as well as static content.
The section can be either statically generated or dynamically generated from the render class.

In this guide, we will explain to you when to create sections based view in your application.

1. Use this if you have static content to display.
2. Use this if you have a section that won't be repeated.
3. Use this if you have to create a reusable section.

If you are confused on what to use, consider it to be the default view type to use.
